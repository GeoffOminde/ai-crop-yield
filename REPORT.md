# ðŸŒ± Crop Yield Prediction for Food Security (SDG 2)

**Problem (SDG 2: Zero Hunger):**  
Global hunger persists due to unpredictable harvests caused by climate change and poor resource management. Farmers often lack forecasting tools, leading to food shortages or waste.  

**Solution (AI/ML Approach):**  
We developed a **machine learning model** that predicts crop yields using rainfall, temperature, soil pH, and fertilizer usage.  
- **Approach:** Supervised Learning (Regression).  
- **Techniques:** Linear Regression & Random Forest.  
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib.  

**Results:**  
- Random Forest achieved **better accuracy** than Linear Regression.  
- Predictions matched closely with actual yields (visualized in scatter plot).  
- This can help farmers and policymakers make better decisions.  

**Ethical Considerations:**  
- **Bias:** Datasets may underrepresent rural farms.  
- **Fairness:** Should be deployed equitably for all communities.  
- **Sustainability:** Accurate forecasting reduces waste, optimizes resources, and strengthens food systems.  

âœ… This project demonstrates how AI can directly support **SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)** by empowering sustainable agriculture.
